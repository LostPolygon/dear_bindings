--- v0.02

Removed some more ImVector functions that don't compile correctly due to the lack of operator== on certain types
Removed ImNewWrapper on newer ImGui versions
Made LogTextV() only get added on ImGui version that don't supply it themselves
Renamed IMGUI_API to CIMGUI_API
Added (void) to declarations of C functions with no arguments
Fixed field declarations not identifying the IMGUI_API prefix
Made self parameters on const functions be const
Got rid of excessive use of struct qualifier and added autogenerated forward declarations to compensate
Removed unnecessary header files and made the stdbool.h include get added in a more sensible place
Changed ImVec2/ImVec4 to be treated as by-value types and avoid new() in their constructors
Removed hacky "orignal fully-qualified type" system and replaced it with "unmodified_element", which links all DOM elements back to a copy of the unmodified DOM
Changed stub code generation to include both the original and generated headers, and cast correctly when passing arguments around
Added lots of namespace-related shenanigans to deal with using namespaces to separate the C and C++ headers
Added by-value struct conversion functions
Added support for converting arrays of by-value types
Removed all of the ImVector functions as they're probably more dangerous than useful
Tidied up filename handling a bit
Added support for base class lists on class declarations
Added support for comments in a few more places
Added support for adding a name prefix to all loose functions
Make function name disambiguation aware of mutually-exclusive #ifdefs, and added manual exclusions
Fixed escaped character literals not getting parsed correctly
Fixed namespaced typenames not getting parsed correctly sometimes
Fixed #error and #undef not getting parsed
Made operator name parsing more generic and able to cope with things like "operator+=" without the previous ugly special-casing
Made it possible to have multiple header files in the DOM
Changed ImGui class prefix
Fixed function/structure removal not removing associated template DOM element
Added class member accessibility support
Removed IM_VEC2_CLASS_EXTRA from generated file
Added metadata generator
Fixed comments getting incorrectly treated as part of the expression for preprocessor conditionals
